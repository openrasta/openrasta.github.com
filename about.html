<h1>OpenRasta's history</h1>

<p>
    OpenRasta was first released as a preview on 6 December 2008.
    </p>

<p>
    It is branded with a 2.0 version because the first version was not made publicly available.
    </p>

<p>
    The 2.0 beta 1 release was made available in April 2009, providing HTML support, binders for model creation and support for HTML forms, as well as json, XML and webforms support.
    </p>

<p>
    The 2.0 beta 2 release was made available on 21 August 2009,[4] and was the first version to be completely decoupled from the asp.net framework, as well as come packaged in a Windows installer format with Visual Studio 2008 integration.
    </p>

<p>
    The 2.0 Release Candidate expands on some of the features of beta 2 by having a pluggable type system, and provides many bug fixes over the previous release.
